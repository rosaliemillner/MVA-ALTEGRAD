# Labs: Advanced Learning for Text and Graph Data
2024-2025 course at the MVA (Mathématiques, Vision, Apprentissage) at École Normale Supérieure Paris-Saclay.

There are going to be 6 Labs in total, using Python with various frameworks such as: PyTorch, Hugging Face Transformers, Networkx,...

The 3 first Labs are about Deep Learning text data (NLP) and the 3 last ones are Machine Learning and Deep Learning for graph data.


The covered topics are:

- Lab 1: Hierarchical Attention Network and Self-Attention
- Lab 2: Transformers, Transfer Learning in NLP
- Lab 3: Large Language Models (LLMs), fine-tuning with LoRA + quantization
- Lab 4: Machine Learning for Graphs
- Lab 5: (to come)
- Lab 6: (to come)
